## DNS (Domain Name System)
- helps map the ip to a domain name of a website
- it operates at the application layer

- DNS traffic uses UDP port 53 by default and TCP port 53 as a default fallback. There are many types of DNS records; however, in this task, we will focus on the following four:

- **A record**: The A (Address) record maps a hostname to one or more IPv4 addresses. For example, you can set `example.com` to resolve to `172.17.2.172`.
- **AAAA Record**: The AAAA record is similar to the A Record, but it is for IPv6. Remember that it is AAAA (quad-A), as AA and AAA would refer to a battery size; furthermore, AAA refers to _Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting_; neither falls under DNS.
- **CNAME Record**: The CNAME (Canonical Name) record maps a domain name to another domain name. For example, `www.example.com` can be mapped to `example.com` or even to `example.org`.
- **MX Record**: The MX (Mail Exchange) record specifies the mail server responsible for handling emails for a domain.

If you want to look up the IP address of a domain from the command line, you can use a tool such as `nslookup`. Consider the example in the terminal below where we look up `example.com`.

Terminal

```shell-session
user@TryHackMe$ nslookup www.example.com
Server:         127.0.0.53
Address:        127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   www.example.com
Address: 93.184.215.14
Name:   www.example.com
Address: 2606:2800:21f:cb07:6820:80da:af6b:8b2c
```

## WHOIS
- anyone who purchases a domain name is given the power or authority to set the records for that domain
- all this data is publically available on WHOIS
- we can use the online services of the WHOIS or the command 
- ```whois
  ```
  - a WHOIS record provides information about the entity that registered a domain name, including name, phone number, email, and address.
## HTTPS
- this protocol relies on TCP 

- Some of the commands or methods that your web browser commonly issues to the web server are:
	
- `GET` retrieves data from a server, such as an HTML file or an image.
- `POST` allows us to submit new data to the server, such as submitting a form or uploading a file.
- `PUT` is used to create a new resource on the server and to update and overwrite existing information.
- `DELETE`, as the name suggests, is used to delete a specified file or resource on the server.

HTTP and HTTPS commonly use TCP ports 80 and 443, respectively, and less commonly other ports such as 8080 and 8443.

## Wireshark

Using Wireshark, we can examine the exchange between the Firefox browser and the web server more closely. The screenshot below from Wireshark shows the text sent by our browser in **red** and the web server response in **blue**. As you can tell, a lot of information is exchanged between the client and the server that does not get rendered to the user. Examples include the web server version and when the page was last modified.

## FTP (file transfer protocol)
- used to transfer files
- Example commands defined by the FTP protocol are:

- `USER` is used to input the username
- `PASS` is used to enter the password
- `RETR` (retrieve) is used to download a file from the FTP server to the client.
- `STOR` (store) is used to upload a file from the client to the FTP server.

FTP server listens on TCP port 21 by default; data transfer is conducted via another connection from the client to the server.

We used Wireshark to examine the exchanged messages more closely. The client’s messages are in **red**, while the server’s responses are in **blue**. Notice how various commands differ between the client and the server. For example, when you type `ls` on the client, the client sends `LIST` to the server. One last thing to note is that the directory listing and the file we downloaded are sent over a separate connection each.

## SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol)
- the default port address is 25
- tells how a mail client talks with a mail server and vice versa
- The analogy for the SMTP protocol is when you go to the local post office to send a package. You greet the employee, tell them where you want to send your package, and provide the sender’s information before handing them the package. Depending on the country you are in, you might be asked to show your identity card. This process is not very different from an SMTP session.
- Let’s present some of the commands used by your mail client when it transfers an email to an SMTP server:

- `HELO` or `EHLO` initiates an SMTP session
- `MAIL FROM` specifies the sender’s email address
- `RCPT TO` specifies the recipient’s email address
- `DATA` indicates that the client will begin sending the content of the email message
- `.` is sent on a line by itself to indicate the end of the email message

## POP3(post office protocol version 3)
- Without going into in-depth technical details, an email client sends its messages by relying on SMTP and retrieves them using POP3. SMTP is similar to handing your envelope or package to the post office, and POP3 is similar to checking your local mailbox for new letters or packages.
- it operates on port 110
- Some common POP3 commands are:

- `USER <username>` identifies the user
- `PASS <password>` provides the user’s password
- `STAT` requests the number of messages and total size
- `LIST` lists all messages and their sizes
- `RETR <message_number>` retrieves the specified message
- `DELE <message_number>` marks a message for deletion
- `QUIT` ends the POP3 session applying changes, such as deletions

## IMAP (internet message access protocol)
- IMAP allows synchronizing read, moved, and deleted messages. IMAP is quite convenient when you check your email via multiple clients. Unlike POP3, which tends to minimize server storage as email is downloaded and deleted from the remote server, IMAP tends to use more storage as email is kept on the server and synchronized across the email clients.

- The IMAP protocol commands are more complicated than the POP3 protocol commands. We list a few examples below:

- `LOGIN <username> <password>` authenticates the user
- `SELECT <mailbox>` selects the mailbox folder to work with
- `FETCH <mail_number> <data_item_name>` Example `fetch 3 body[]` to fetch message number 3, header and body.
- `MOVE <sequence_set> <mailbox>` moves the specified messages to another mailbox
- `COPY <sequence_set> <data_item_name>` copies the specified messages to another mailbox
- `LOGOUT` logs out
