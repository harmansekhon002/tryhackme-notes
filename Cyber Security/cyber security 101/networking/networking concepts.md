## ip addressing and subnetting
### subnetting
- If you are wondering, a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0` can also be written as `/24`. 
- The `/24` means that the leftmost 24 bits within the IP address do not change across the network, i.e., the subnet. 
- In other words, the leftmost three octets are the same across the whole subnet; therefore, we can expect to find addresses that range from `192.168.66.1` to `192.168.66.254`. 
- Similar to what was mentioned earlier, `192.168.66.0` and `192.168.66.255` are the network and broadcast addresses, respectively.
### Private Addresses

As we are explaining IP addresses, it is useful to mention that for most practical purposes, there are two types of IP addresses:

- Public IP addresses
- Private IP addresses

RFC 1918 defines the following three ranges of private IP addresses:

- `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255` (`10/8`)
- `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255` (`172.16/12`)
- `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255` (`192.168/16`)

We presented earlier an analogy stating that a public IP address is like your home postal address. A private IP address is different; the original idea is that it cannot reach or be reached from the outside world. It is like an isolated city or a compound, where all houses and apartments are numbered systematically and can easily exchange mail with each other, but not with the outside world. For a private IP address to access the Internet, the router must have a public IP address and must support Network Address Translation (NAT). At this stage, let’s not worry about understanding how NAT works, as we will revisit it later in this module.

### UDP

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) allows us to reach a specific process on this target host. UDP is a simple connectionless protocol that operates at the transport layer, i.e., layer 4. Being connectionless means that it does not need to establish a connection. UDP does not even provide a mechanism to know that the packet has been delivered.

An IP address identifies the host; we need a mechanism to determine the sending and receiving process. This can be achieved by using port numbers. A port number uses two octets; consequently, it ranges between 1 and 65535; port 0 is reserved. (The number 65535 is calculated by the expression 216 − 1.)

A real-life example similar to UDP is the standard mail service, with no delivery confirmation. In other words, there is no guarantee that the UDP packet has been received successfully, similar to the case of sending a parcel using standard mail with no confirmation of delivery. In the case of standard mail, it means a cheaper cost than the mail delivery options with confirmation. In the case of UDP, it means better speed than a transport protocol that provides “confirmation.”

But what if we want a transport protocol that acknowledges received packets? The answer lies in using TCP instead of UDP.

### TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented transport protocol. It uses various mechanisms to ensure reliable data delivery sent by the different processes on the networked hosts. Like UDP, it is a layer 4 protocol. Being connection-oriented, it requires the establishment of a TCP connection before any data can be sent.

In TCP, each data octet has a sequence number; this makes it easy for the receiver to identify lost or duplicated packets. The receiver, on the other hand, acknowledges the reception of data with an acknowledgement number specifying the last received octet.

A TCP connection is established using what’s called a three-way handshake. Two flags are used: SYN (Synchronise) and ACK (Acknowledgment). The packets are sent as follows:

1. SYN Packet: The client initiates the connection by sending a SYN packet to the server. This packet contains the client’s randomly chosen initial sequence number.
2. SYN-ACK Packet: The server responds to the SYN packet with a SYN-ACK packet, which adds the initial sequence number randomly chosen by the server.
3. ACK Packet: The three-way handshake is completed as the client sends an ACK packet to acknowledge the reception of the SYN-ACK packet.

## telnet

- the TELNET (Teletype Network) protocol is a network protocol for remote terminal connection. In simpler words, `telnet`, a TELNET client, allows you to connect to and communicate with a remote system and issue text commands. Although initially it was used for remote administration, we can use `telnet` to connect to any server listening on a TCP port number.

On the target virtual machine, different services are running. We will experiment with three of them:

- Echo server: This server echoes everything you send it. By default, it listens on port 7.
- Daytime server: This server listens on port 13 by default and replies with the current day and time.
- Web (HTTP) server: This server listens on TCP port 80 by default and serves web pages.
